# Super Leauge Total Goal Predict

I've built a machine learning model using the CatBoost algorithm and deployed it on both Streamlit and Flutter platforms. However, due to insufficient data on matches played in the Super League, the performance of the model is not very effective. This model is capable of predicting match outcomes and total goals, but obtaining more data could lead to more accurate results.
